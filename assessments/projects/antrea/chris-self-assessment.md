# Self-assessment
The Self-assessment is the initial document for projects to begin thinking about the
security of the project, determining gaps in their security, and preparing any security
documentation for their users. This document is ideal for projects currently in the
CNCF **sandbox** as well as projects that are looking to receive a joint assessment and
currently in CNCF **incubation**.

## Overview

One or two sentences describing the project -- something memorable and accurate
that distinguishes your project to quickly orient readers who may be assessing
multiple projects.

### Background

Provide information for reviewers who may not be familiar with your project's
domain or problem area.

### Actors
The Antrea Agent: A primary actor in this ecosystem is the Antrea Agent, deployed on each Kubernetes node. This agent is pivotal in managing the networking of pods, interfacing directly with the Open vSwitch (OVS) to execute data plane operations. It applies the network policies as defined in Kubernetes, thereby playing a critical role in regulating network traffic and enforcing security rules at the node level.

The Antrea Controller: Complementing the Antrea Agent is the Antrea Controller, a centralized component that administers the entire Antrea CNI deployment across the cluster. Its primary function is to process network policies, ensuring uniform implementation throughout the Kubernetes cluster. The Antrea Controller maintains an overarching view of the network state and policies, facilitating a coordinated approach to network management and security.

Kubernetes API Server Interaction: External to Antrea but integral to its operation is the Kubernetes API Server. This actor serves as the communication hub for Antrea, providing the necessary information about network policies, pod lifecycle events, and other essential Kubernetes resources. The interaction between Antrea and the Kubernetes API Server is fundamental for the dynamic adaptation of network configurations in response to changes within the Kubernetes environment.

Open vSwitch (OVS): At the heart of the data plane operations lies the Open vSwitch (OVS), a high-performance, multilayer virtual switch. OVS is responsible for forwarding network packets based on the configurations and policies set by the Antrea Agents. It forms the backbone of the network’s data plane, efficiently handling network traffic within the cluster.

### Actions
These are the steps that a project performs in order to provide some service
or functionality.  These steps are performed by different actors in the system.
Note, that an action need not be overly descriptive at the function call level.  
It is sufficient to focus on the security checks performed, use of sensitive 
data, and interactions between actors to perform an action.  

For example, the access server receives the client request, checks the format, 
validates that the request corresponds to a file the client is authorized to 
access, and then returns a token to the client.  The client then transmits that 
token to the file server, which, after confirming its validity, returns the file.

### Goals
The main goal of Antrea is to enhance network connectivity and security within Kubernetes clusters. It focuses on ensuring that containers can communicate efficiently and securely, using strict network policies to allow only authorized traffic. Antrea uses Open vSwitch for high-performance networking, making it suitable for large deployments. In terms of security, Antrea encrypts data moving across the cluster to protect against potential breaches. However, it's important to note that Antrea primarily addresses network-level security, not broader security issues like application vulnerabilities. Overall, Antrea's aim is to provide a reliable and secure networking solution for Kubernetes environments.

### Non-goals
Non-goals that a reasonable reader of the project’s literature could believe may
be in scope (e.g., Flibble does not intend to stop a party with a key from storing
an arbitrarily large amount of data, possibly incurring financial cost or overwhelming
 the servers)

## Self-assessment use

This self-assessment is created by the [project] team to perform an internal analysis of the
project's security.  It is not intended to provide a security audit of [project], or
function as an independent assessment or attestation of [project]'s security health.

This document serves to provide [project] users with an initial understanding of
[project]'s security, where to find existing security documentation, [project] plans for
security, and general overview of [project] security practices, both for development of
[project] as well as security of [project].

This document provides the CNCF TAG-Security with an initial understanding of [project]
to assist in a joint-assessment, necessary for projects under incubation.  Taken
together, this document and the joint-assessment serve as a cornerstone for if and when
[project] seeks graduation and is preparing for a security audit.

## Security functions and features

* Critical.  A listing critical security components of the project with a brief
description of their importance.  It is recommended these be used for threat modeling.
These are considered critical design elements that make the product itself secure and
are not configurable.  Projects are encouraged to track these as primary impact items
for changes to the project.
* Security Relevant.  A listing of security relevant components of the project with
  brief description.  These are considered important to enhance the overall security of
the project, such as deployment configurations, settings, etc.  These should also be
included in threat modeling.

## Project compliance
Regarding the compliance of the Antrea project with established security standards, there is no direct documentation or claim that Antrea meets specific standards like PCI-DSS, COBIT, ISO standards, GDPR, or others. Antrea's primary role is as a network plugin for Kubernetes, focusing on network connectivity and security within Kubernetes clusters. Although it incorporates security measures that may align with aspects of these standards, particularly in network security and data protection, it does not explicitly conform to these standards as a standalone entity. For organizations using Antrea, ensuring compliance with such standards would typically involve evaluating their entire Kubernetes architecture, including Antrea, as part of a comprehensive compliance strategy. Thus, while Antrea plays a role in creating a secure network environment, its compliance with specific security standards would ultimately be determined by how it is integrated and used within an organization's broader Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Secure development practices

* Development Pipeline.  A description of the testing and assessment processes that
  the software undergoes as it is developed and built. Be sure to include specific
information such as if contributors are required to sign commits, if any container
images immutable and signed, how many reviewers before merging, any automated checks for
vulnerabilities, etc.
* Communication Channels. Reference where you document how to reach your team or
  describe in corresponding section.
  * Internal. How do team members communicate with each other?
  * Inbound. How do users or prospective users communicate with the team?
  * Outbound. How do you communicate with your users? (e.g. flibble-announce@
    mailing list)
* Ecosystem. How does your software fit into the cloud native ecosystem?  (e.g.
  Flibber is integrated with both Flocker and Noodles which covers
virtualization for 80% of cloud users. So, our small number of "users" actually
represents very wide usage across the ecosystem since every virtual instance uses
Flibber encryption by default.)

## Security issue resolution

* Responsible Disclosures Process. A outline of the project's responsible
  disclosures process should suspected security issues, incidents, or
vulnerabilities be discovered both external and internal to the project. The
outline should discuss communication methods/strategies.
  * Vulnerability Response Process. Who is responsible for responding to a
    report. What is the reporting process? How would you respond?
* Incident Response. A description of the defined procedures for triage,
  confirmation, notification of vulnerability or security incident, and
patching/update availability.

## Appendix

* Known Issues Over Time. List or summarize statistics of past vulnerabilities
  with links. If none have been reported, provide data, if any, about your track
record in catching issues in code review or automated testing.
* [CII Best Practices](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/programs/best-practices-program/).
  Best Practices. A brief discussion of where the project is at
  with respect to CII best practices and what it would need to
  achieve the badge.
* Case Studies. Provide context for reviewers by detailing 2-3 scenarios of
  real-world use cases.
* Related Projects / Vendors. Reflect on times prospective users have asked
  about the differences between your project and projectX. Reviewers will have
the same question.
