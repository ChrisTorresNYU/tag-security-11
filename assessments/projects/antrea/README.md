# Note about Self-Assessment Multiple Files
Self-assessment.md is split into multiple files during the draft phase to
facilitate easier commits when writers are working in parallel.

Before Part 3.1 is submitted, all changes should be merged into self-assessment.md,
all group members' files should be deleted, and this README.md file should
be deleted.
